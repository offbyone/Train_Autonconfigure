# What does this mod do?

This mod makes automated trains (NOT manual trains) automatically color themselves whenever they start moving on a path with an appropriate color based on the resource they're carrying. If a train is carrying more than one type of resource the color will blend appropriately (e.g. iron is blue, copper is red- carrying 50% iron and 50% copper will make the train purple)

# What other mods does this support?

- Bob's ores (+ plates)
- Angel's ores (+ plates)
- Dark Matter Replicator

This does *not* currently support any fluid barrels.

# (For developers) Compatibility

You may contact me and let me know appropriate RGB colors for each of your resource types, as well as their internal name and I'll add them to the base mod.
